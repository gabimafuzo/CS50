Relying solely on the metrics of Energy, Valence, and Danceability to interpret the 'aura' of a song may not correspond with reality, as it is very subjective. Songs with high energy are usually intense and lively, but they can also be aggressive, depending on the instrumentation and context, such as 'Rock and Roll'. Similarly, high valence generally indicates a happy song, but a song with low valence can still have a positive emotional impact. High danceability suggests that the music is danceable and positive, but not all danceable songs are necessarily happy. For example, in 'Funk Carioca', high energy and danceability are prominent characteristics, but the lyrics can address serious and even sad themes. Other example is 'Bossa Nova', the smooth rhythm and low energy can convey a sense of tranquility, but the melancholic and introspective lyrics often create a more contemplative atmosphere, even in songs with high valence.In summary, it is a very subjective and variable classification.
